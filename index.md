## What is BullyBash?
BullyBash is an annual bulldog meetup in Cleveland, Ohio, created by people who met through their dogs on Twitter.
Activities include everything from limo bus tours (with dogs, of course) to bulldog pool parties.
And, of course, petting, playing with, dressing up, and taking pictures of everybody's dogs.

## Our Ideals
**We don't care** where you are from, what you look like, or what your heritage is. We don't care whether you live in the city or the country or the suburbs,
or whether you worship the way we do (or not at all). It doesn't make a difference to us whether you have a little or a lot.
We don't care about pedigrees, diplomas or degrees unless we are helping you celebrate an accomplishment (in which case we
are super proud of you).

**We do care** if you are kind. It matters to us that you are warm and compassionate to all humans and creatures.
We are people who reach out our hands and mean it when we say, "It's so nice to meet you." We love to laugh. We kiss dogs.
We know there is unfathomable ugliness in the world and we give each other actual living proof of the kindness of strangers.

We may also be a *little bit* crazy.
