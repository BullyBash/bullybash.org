Join us for BullyBash 2023! This hillarious annual event takes place in Cleveland, Ohio on Memorial Day weekend.
This year, the fun starts on Friday, May 26 and lasts until Sunday, May 28. Many guests choose to arrive earlier
in the week to explore the city.

BullyBash is not just for bulldogs. All well-behaved dogs are welcome. Well-behaved humans are also welcome with or without
their canine companions. 

If you plan to attend in-person, please register below. If you just want to follow along online, follow BullyBash on Twitter 
[@BullyBashCLE](https://twitter.com/bullybashcle) for live updates.
